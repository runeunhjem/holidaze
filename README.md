## Description

Holidaze is a project that was created as a part of the final exam in the course Frontend Development 2 at Noroff. The project is a fictional venue booking site where users can book hotels, send inquiries, and read more about the venues or add their own venues for other users to look at or book. The project is built with Vite, React and MUI, and the data is fetched from Noroff's Holidaze API. The project is responsive and works on all devices.
